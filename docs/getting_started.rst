Introduction

pynetdicom is a pure python package implementing the DICOM network
protocol. It uses the pydicom package.

(SCPs). The following service classes are currently supported, both as
SCU and SCP:

  * Verification

pynetdicom is easy to install and use, and because it is a pure 
python package, it should run anywhere python runs.
