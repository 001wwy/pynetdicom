1.1.0
=====

Fixes
.....

* No longer using a list as the default value for the ``transfer_syntax``
  keyword argument in ``AE.add_requested_context()``,
  ``AE.add_supported_context()`` and ``presentation.build_context()``
* Completely fixed handling a maximum PDU length of 0. (:issue:`193`)
* ``DIMSEMessage`` subclass creation and ``DIMSEMessage.primitive_to_message``
  should now be thread-safe (:issue:`137`)

Enhancements
............

* Added ``select_timeout`` parameter to ``Association.start()`` to allow the
  user to specify how long the select.select() call blocks for.
* Improved the CPU usage of the AE when running idle as an SCP (:issue:`60`).


Changes
.......

* ``AE.quit()`` is deprecated and will be removed in v1.2. Use ``AE.stop()``
  instead.
* ``DIMSEMessage.ID`` is deprecated and will be removed in v1.2. Use
  ``DIMSEMessage.context_id`` instead.
* Added ``_globals.py`` for frequently used global constants.
* ``utils.validate_ae_title`` changed to only return bytes for Python 3
* ``AE.require_called_aet`` and ``AE.require_calling_aet`` now take a list
  of AE titles (as bytes) rather than a single AE title. During association
  negotiation (as acceptor) the value of the *Called AE Title* and *Calling AE
  Title* parameters will be compared to those in the lists and if no matches
  are found the association rejected. If the ``require_called_aet`` and
  ``require_calling_aet`` are set to empty lists then no matching will be
  performed and the association accepted (unless rejected for other reasons).
